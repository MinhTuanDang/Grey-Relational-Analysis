# Grey-Relational-Analysis
An improved implementation of the most widely used models of the grey system theory of Deng Julong in decision analysis

Used to feature subset selection, heterogeneity of data sets, outlier analysis, and fault prediction

Grey System Theory strives to give theory, methodologies, conceptions, and ideas for resolving and studying latent and complicated systems.
It investigates problems with tiny samples and insufficient information that are difficult for probability and fuzzy mathematics to solve, typically with partially known, erroneous, or missing information.


Grey relation analysis determines the absolute point-to-point distance between various situations and aims to reduce uncertainty in distances.
The primary purpose of GRA is to identify n similar metrics from a reference metric using the grey relational grade (GRG) and then regress the prediction of fault-proneness using those metrics.
GRA uses the grey relational coefficient (GRC) and grey relational grade (GRG) to measure the absolute distance between reference and comparative projects.
